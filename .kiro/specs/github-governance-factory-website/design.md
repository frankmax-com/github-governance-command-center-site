# Design Document

## Overview

This document outlines the design for a Hugo-based marketing website for "GitHub Governance Command Center" - the ONLY fail-proof defense against the 45+ catastrophic threats that can annihilate Fortune 500 companies overnight. The website will leverage the existing Frankmax theme while creating an urgent, threat-focused brand identity that triggers immediate fear and action in executives facing existential risks.

The design emphasizes imminent danger, catastrophic consequences, and Command Center as the sole salvation from corporate extinction. Every element is designed to create urgency, fear, and immediate action through threat visualization, crisis messaging, and survival positioning.

## Architecture

### Site Structure

The website will be a Hugo static site with single-page behavior through anchor-linked sections, similar to the existing Frankmax site, but optimized for enterprise B2B conversion:

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Crisis Alert Hero (IMMEDIATE THREAT WARNING)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Catastrophic Threat Reality (45+ Attack Vectors Active NOW)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Complete Threat Solution Matrix (Technical Architecture)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Survival Solution (Command Center = Only Defense)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Industry Apocalypse Scenarios (6 Sector Extinction Events)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Disaster Prevention Proof (128+ Companies Saved)
