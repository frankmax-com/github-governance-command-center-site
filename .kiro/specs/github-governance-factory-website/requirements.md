# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for building a Hugo-based marketing website that exposes the CATASTROPHIC REALITY facing every Fortune 500 company: **Your GitHub is a ticking time bomb with 45+ active attack vectors targeting your organization RIGHT NOW.**

Every enterprise using GitHub Enterprise faces imminent extinction from:
- **Nation-state actors** already inside your repos conducting reconnaissance
- **Insider threats** exfiltrating your crown jewel IP while you sleep  
- **Supply chain poisoning** injecting backdoors into your critical dependencies
- **Regulatory annihilation** with $100M+ fines for compliance failures
- **Civilization-scale dependencies** that could collapse your industry overnight

**THE TERRIFYING TRUTH:** GitHub Enterprise provides ZERO defense against these 45+ catastrophic threat categories. Your organization is defensively naked, bleeding money, and one breach away from corporate extinction.

**THE ONLY SOLUTION:** GitHub Governance Command Center - the fail-proof counter-defense system that transforms your vulnerable GitHub into an impenetrable fortress. This is not about "better security" - this is about SURVIVAL vs. ANNIHILATION.

**The Stakes:** Corporate survival, $100M+ regulatory fines prevented, and the difference between market leadership and bankruptcy in an era where a single breach triggers total collapse.

## Requirements
