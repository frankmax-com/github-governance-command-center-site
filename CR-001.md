1) High-level objective (one sentence)

Stop the panic-siren UX and ship a calm, professional design system that auto-switches day/night by the client’s local time, allows a manual override that persists, and improves spacing/typography/accessibility across the site.

2) Design system summary (what to insist on)

Theme: clean white light as default; thoughtful dark for evening. Replace “crisis red” with professional blue gradient for brand accents.

Typography: Inter (or equivalent modern sans). Clear hierarchy: H1 (large, tight leading), H2, H3, body at 16px baseline.

Spacing: defined scale (xs → 3xl). Enforce via design tokens in the design system.

Containers: responsive max-widths (mobile → 100%, desktop → 1200px).

Components: cards, primary/secondary buttons, nav, form inputs, modals — use consistent radii and shadows.

Motion: subtle transitions only; respect prefers-reduced-motion.

3) Theme behavior (spec — precise, no code)

Auto-detect: Use the client’s browser clock/timezone to determine local hour.

Day window: 06:00 — 17:59 → Light theme.

Night window: 18:00 — 05:59 → Dark theme.

Manual override:

User can toggle theme in header (sun/moon icon). Manual choice always takes precedence over auto.

Preserve manual choice across sessions (persist in browser storage).

UI expectations:

Header toggle should show the current mode (icon + tooltip).

Theme transitions should be smooth and non-jarring.

No flashing or layout reflow when theme applies.

4) Header & navigation requirements

Clean left-aligned logo (SVG), simple text nav (Solutions, Governance, Docs, Contact).

Remove emojis and panic labels from nav — plain text only.

Place theme toggle on the right, next to a compact language selector and a professional CTA (e.g., “Get started”).

Mobile: hamburger with large touch target; navigation items stacked with sufficient spacing.

5) Microcopy & labels (exact text to use)

Theme toggle aria-label: “Toggle color theme”; aria-pressed used to indicate state.

Logo alt text: “Company logo” (replace with brand name if provided).

Header CTA: “Get started” (primary) and “Read docs” (secondary).

Hero headline (hero recommended copy):
“Professional GitHub governance — secure, compliant, predictable.”
Subcopy: “Consolidate policy, automate approvals, and scale secure development across your org.”

Trust row label: “Trusted by” (followed by monochrome client logos).

6) Visual priorities (what the design lead must enforce)

Replace bright emergency red with a professional blue gradient for primary actions and accents.

Ensure contrast ratios meet WCAG AA (4.5:1 normal text; 3:1 for large text).

Cards: subtle elevation, soft rounded corners, hover lift.

Buttons: primary (filled, gradient), secondary (ghost/outlined).

Images/logos: monochrome variants for trust row.

7) Accessibility & a11y rules (must pass)

All interactive controls keyboard-focusable with visible focus state.

Theme toggle must expose current state via ARIA attributes.

Respect prefers-reduced-motion — allow users to disable motion.

Minimum touch target: 44–48px for mobile actions.

Run automated audits (axe, Lighthouse) and remediate all critical failures.

8) Performance & progressive enhancement (policy)

Theme decision works without server-side detection — client-side local hour used as source of truth.

If storage is disabled, site must still load with auto-detected theme and not error.

Avoid large frameworks for the header/theme behavior; prefer micro-approach — but that’s a developer implementation note only.

9) QA / Acceptance tests (copy these into your QA ticket)

Auto theme detection

Simulate client local time at 07:00 → site loads in light theme.

Simulate client local time at 20:00 → site loads in dark theme.

Manual override persistence

Toggle theme to dark, reload page → theme remains dark.

Clear stored preference, reload → auto-detect resumes.

Manual priority

After manual choice is set, changing system prefers-color-scheme or time must not override the user choice.

Accessibility

Theme toggle reachable by keyboard, aria-pressed updates, focus visible.

All pages pass color-contrast checks (report).

10) Design handoff checklist (give this to designers)

Provide token list: font family, font weights, spacing tokens (xs→3xl), radii, elevation, semantic colors (bg, surface, text, brand, success, warning, danger).

Export SVG icons: logo, sun, moon (mono + filled variants).

Provide monochrome versions of partner logos.

Deliver hero layout (desktop/tablet/mobile) in Figma with spacing constraints.

Provide copy variants for CTAs and trust row.

11) Product/PM acceptance criteria (what product must confirm)

UI shows theme toggle in header, user can toggle it, preference persists.

Default behavior is deterministic by client local hour (06:00–18:00 light; 18:00–06:00 dark).

All crisis language removed; CTAs and nav look professional.

Lighthouse accessibility score improved (target: >=90 for a11y).

No visual flash or content shift caused by theme swap.

12) Suggested analytics & monitoring (non-invasive)

Capture anonymized event counts: theme_auto_applied, theme_user_override. No PII.

Run nightly Lighthouse job in CI to track regressions in a11y and performance.

13) Rollout plan (small, safe)

Design complete + tokens committed to design system.

Dev implements header + theme behavior behind a feature flag.

QA runs acceptance tests (above).

Canary release to 5% traffic for 48 hours. Monitor logs and client feedback.

Full rollout and CI monitor enabled.

14) Communication to stakeholders (copy to paste)

We’re replacing the emergency UI with a professional design system that auto-switches day/night based on each user’s local time, includes a persistent manual theme toggle, removes crisis language, and improves spacing, typography, and accessibility. Expect improved trust signals and reduced user friction. Plan: staged rollout with a 48-hour canary phase.

15) Handy deliverables you can ask me for next (pick 2)

SVG sun/moon button designs (no code, just assets & specs).

Exact CSS variables + token list in plain text (no code blocks).

A short accessibility remediation plan with priority actions.
