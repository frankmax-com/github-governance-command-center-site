## What goes wrong
- Developers accidentally push plaintext secrets
- Bots and attackers monitor public and internal repos
- Secrets are used within minutes to pivot into cloud, CI, or data stores

## Signals
- Unexpected OAuth token usage spikes
- CI jobs triggered from unusual IP ranges
- Repo stars/watchers spike following a sensitive commit

## Business impact
- Breach MTTD measured in hours → costs measured in $M
- Regulatory reporting and fines (GDPR/PCI)
- Lost customer trust and incident response overhead

## Countermeasures (Command Center)
- Pre-commit AI firewall: blocks secret payloads before they land
- Immutable redaction: auto-rewrites and rotates compromised keys
- Continuous scanning: org-wide detectors with zero hardcoding
- Governance labels + response runbooks: instant, auditable remediation
