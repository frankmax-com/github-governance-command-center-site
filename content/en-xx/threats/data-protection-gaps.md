**How It Works:**
- **AI-Powered Pre-Commit Guardian:** 17 AI providers analyze every commit before GitHub
- **Regulatory-Aware Detection:** Knows GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, SOX requirements per repo
- **Immutable Redaction:** Sensitive data tokenized and stored in HSM vault
- **Audit Trail Generation:** Every blocked commit creates regulator-ready evidence

**The Result:** Impossible to commit sensitive data. Zero remediation needed. Audit-ready compliance.
