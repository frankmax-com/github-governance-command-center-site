### 5.2 Service Mesh Configuration

**Service Discovery & Communication**:
```
SERVICE MESH CONFIGURATION:

SERVICE_REGISTRY:
  governance-engine: http://governance-engine:8001
  issue-management: http://issue-management:8002
  project-orchestration: http://project-orchestration:8003
  analytics-reporting: http://analytics-reporting:8004

  timeout: 30s
  retry_attempts: 3

CIRCUIT_BREAKER:
  failure_threshold: 5
  timeout: 60s
  half_open_max_calls: 3
```

## 6. Data Management Strategy

### 6.1 Database Allocation Strategy

**MongoDB Use Cases**:
- Configuration management and governance rules
- Project specifications and hierarchical structures  
- Agent service metadata and automation rules
- Event logs and workflow state management

**Supabase Use Cases**:
- Issue tracking and relational data
- Analytics and reporting data
- User management and authentication
- Audit trails and compliance logging

**Redis Use Cases**:
- Session management and authentication tokens
- Real-time event streaming and pub/sub messaging
- API response caching and performance optimization
- Rate limiting and resource management

### 6.2 Data Consistency Patterns

**Eventual Consistency Strategy**:
```
DATA CONSISTENCY LOGIC:

WHEN cross-service data update required
  BEGIN distributed transaction
  UPDATE primary service data
  PUBLISH change event to Event Processing Service
  
  FOR EACH dependent service
    SUBSCRIBE to change event
    UPDATE local data copy
    ACKNOWLEDGE processing completion
    
  IF all services acknowledge
    COMMIT transaction
    MARK consistency achieved
  ELSE
    TRIGGER consistency reconciliation
    ALERT operations team
```

## 7. Security & Compliance

### 7.1 Authentication & Authorization

**Security Architecture**:
```
AUTHENTICATION FLOW:

WHEN user authentication required
  VALIDATE credentials against Supabase Auth
  GENERATE JWT token with service permissions
  CACHE token in Redis with TTL
  RETURN authenticated session

WHEN service-to-service call made
  VALIDATE service JWT token
  CHECK service permissions in Supabase
  AUTHORIZE request based on service roles
  LOG authorization decision for audit
```

### 7.2 Audit & Compliance

**Compliance Framework**:
```
AUDIT LOGGING LOGIC:

WHEN sensitive operation performed
  CAPTURE operation context and user identity
  RECORD operation details in Supabase audit table
  ENCRYPT sensitive data elements
  ASSIGN audit trail identifier
  
WHEN compliance report requested
  QUERY audit data from Supabase
  APPLY compliance filters and criteria
  GENERATE compliance report
  ENCRYPT and store report securely
```

## 8. Performance & Scalability

### 8.1 Horizontal Scaling Strategy

**Auto-scaling Configuration**:
```
SCALING LOGIC:

WHEN service load exceeds threshold (CPU > 70%)
  TRIGGER horizontal scaling
  DEPLOY additional service instances
  UPDATE load balancer configuration
  DISTRIBUTE load across instances
  
WHEN service load decreases (CPU < 30%)
  TRIGGER scale-down process
  GRACEFULLY terminate excess instances
  PRESERVE ongoing transactions
  UPDATE load balancer configuration
```

### 8.2 Caching Strategy

**Multi-layer Caching**:
```
CACHING STRATEGY:

WHEN data request received
  CHECK Redis cache for existing data
  IF cache hit
    RETURN cached data
    UPDATE cache access metrics
  ELSE
    QUERY database for data
    STORE result in Redis with appropriate TTL
    RETURN database result
    
WHEN data updated
  UPDATE database record
  INVALIDATE related cache entries
  PUBLISH cache invalidation event
  UPDATE dependent service caches
```

## 9. Monitoring & Observability

### 9.1 Health Monitoring

**Service Health Checks**:
```
HEALTH MONITORING LOGIC:

EVERY health check interval (30 seconds)
  FOR EACH microservice
    CHECK service endpoint availability
    VALIDATE database connectivity
    VERIFY Redis connectivity
